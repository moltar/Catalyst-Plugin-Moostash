Catalyst::Plugin::Moostash - Provides Moose interface for stash

=head1 VERSION

version v0.1.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Define your Moostash class:

 package MyApp::Moostash;

 use Moose;
 extends 'Catalyst::Plugin::Moostash::Base';

 has user_id => (
     is     => 'ro',
     isa    => 'Int',
     writer => 'set_user_id',
 );

Load plugin in MyApp class:

 use Catalyst qw/
     ConfigLoader
     Static::Simple
     ...
     Moostash
 /;

Then use it in your application:

 sub some_action : Local {
     my ($self, $c) = @_;

     $c->moostash->set_user_id($user_id);
 }

Since the Moostash object is stored in the stash, you can conveniently access it
from your View:

 [% m.user_id %]

Also, note that Moostash object receives Catalyst context object into the C<ctx>
attribute.
